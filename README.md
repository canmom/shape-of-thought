Demo created over the weekend of [MountainBytes](https://www.mountainbytes.ch/) 2025. Second Bevy project.

The aim is to visually depict a thought as a high-dimensional oscillation. I was inspired to draw an analogy between feature vectors in machine learning models, and spherical harmonics, as an example of a bunch of basis functions that might be the normal modes of an oscillator.

The brain is derived from MRI data provided by Ronja.
