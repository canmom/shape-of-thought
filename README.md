Demo created over the weekend of [MountainBytes](https://www.mountainbytes.ch/) 2025. Second Bevy project.

The aim is to visually depict a thought as a high-dimensional oscillation. I was inspired to draw an analogy between feature vectors in machine learning models, and spherical harmonics, as an example of a bunch of basis functions that might be the normal modes of an oscillator.

The main challenge was learning how to drive shaders in Bevy, pass data in through a storage buffer, etc.

The brain is derived from an MRI scan provided by Ronja.

Thanks for taking a look at my demo, I can't wait to make more!
