Demo created over the weekend of [MountainBytes](https://www.mountainbytes.ch/) 2025, as part of their DemoLab workshop. This is my second Bevy project.

The aim is to visually depict a thought as a high-dimensional oscillation. I was inspired to draw an analogy between feature vectors in machine learning models, and spherical harmonics, as an example of a bunch of basis functions that might be the normal modes of an oscillator.

The main challenges were learning how to drive shaders in Bevy and pass data in through a storage buffer, etc., as well as computing normals within the vertex shader for the heavy displacement. I could definitely do more (e.g. credits text would be a nice addition) but this was all I had time to do during the party.

The brain is derived from an MRI scan provided by Ronja.

Thanks for taking a look at my demo, I can't wait to make more!
